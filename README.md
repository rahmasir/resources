# Hammasir Bootcamp ‚Äì Neshan Maps

This repository contains my personal resources from the **Hammasir Bootcamp** organized by **Neshan Maps**.  
I created this to share useful materials, document my learning journey, and provide others with insights into the program. 

For many topics, I only used keyword searches on Google and reading articles from reputable reference sites in the field of education, as well as YouTube tutorials. Also, another useful tool is study mode in various artificial intelligence, including chatgpt and creating a sample project with AI can be really useful. You can also use the following roadmaps, which include the introduced resources:
- [backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
- [java roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/java)
- [spring boot roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/spring-boot)
